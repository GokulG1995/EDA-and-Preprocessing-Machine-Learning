EDA and Preprocessing in Machine Learning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing are essential steps in the machine learning workflow to ensure clean, meaningful data for building models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is the initial phase of data analysis where data is explored to summarize its main characteristics, often with visual methods. It helps in understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the data.

Key steps in EDA include:

Data Inspection: Examining the dataset for completeness and understanding its features (columns, data types).
Summary Statistics: Using mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation to understand central tendency and data spread.
Data Visualization: Creating plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.) to identify trends, correlations, outliers, and distributions.
Identifying Missing Values: Detecting and handling missing data, either by imputation or removal.
Outlier Detection: Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the rest, which may need to be removed or transformed.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves preparing raw data for machine learning by transforming it into a format suitable for modeling. This step ensures that data is consistent, clean, and ready for analysis.

Key steps in preprocessing include:

Handling Missing Data: Filling missing values with mean/median, forward/backward filling, or dropping rows/columns.
Data Normalization/Standardization: Scaling features to a similar range or distribution, ensuring no feature dominates due to differing scales.
Encoding Categorical Data: Converting categorical variables into numerical formats (e.g., One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding).
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
Splitting Data: Dividing data into training and testing sets to assess model generalization.
Effective EDA and preprocessing ensure better data quality, leading to improved model accuracy and performance.
